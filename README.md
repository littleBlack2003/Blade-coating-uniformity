# Blade-coating-uniformity
This algorithm is specifically designed for evaluating the uniformity of organic solar cell thin films, with particular focus on analyzing coating direction homogeneity. The methodology quantifies thickness variations in blade-coated organic photovoltaic films by measuring transmittance profiles under uniform backlight illumination.

This algorithm performs grayscale analysis of thin film images for uniformity assessment. The process begins by reading an input image and converting it to grayscale if necessary. The grayscale image is displayed and saved for visual reference.
The core analysis involves generating a coordinate grid system that maps each pixel's spatial position. A data matrix is created containing X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, and corresponding grayscale intensity values for every pixel. This comprehensive dataset is exported to a CSV file with appropriate headers.
For coating direction analysis, the algorithm calculates row-wise average intensity values, which correspond to linear profiles along the coating direction. These row averages are computed by taking the mean intensity across all columns for each row position. The results are stored in a separate CSV file containing row numbers and their corresponding average intensity values.
The algorithm generates a visualization of the intensity profile by plotting row averages against row position. This plot displays the uniformity characteristics along the coating direction, with fixed Y-axis limits from 0-255 to maintain consistent intensity scaling. The visualization is saved as an image file for further analysis.
The process concludes by generating four output files: the grayscale image, coordinate-intensity data, row average values, and the intensity profile plot. This methodology provides quantitative data for assessing film uniformity through spatial intensity mapping and linear profile analysis along the coating direction.
