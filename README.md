# Blade-coating-uniformity
This algorithm is specifically designed for evaluating the uniformity of organic solar cell thin films, with particular focus on analyzing coating direction homogeneity. The methodology quantifies thickness variations in blade-coated organic photovoltaic films by measuring transmittance profiles under uniform backlight illumination.
